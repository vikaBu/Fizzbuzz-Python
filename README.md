A code kata is a fun way for computer programmers to practice coding. They are also used a lot for learning how to implement Test Driven Development (TDD) when writing code. One of the popular programming katas is called FizzBuzz. This is also a popular interview question for computer programmers.

The concept behind FizzBuzz is as follows:

Write a program that prints the numbers 1-100, each on a new line
For each number that is a multiple of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number
For each number that is a multiple of 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number
For each number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number
Now that you know what you need to write, you can get started!
